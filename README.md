# House Price Prediction Project

## Overview
This repository contains a Python-based data science project aimed at predicting house prices. It involves comprehensive data analysis, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning techniques.

## Dataset
The project utilizes the `housing.csv` dataset, encompassing various features like geographical coordinates, total rooms, population, and median income. 

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and preparation of data, with special attention to missing values in `total_bedrooms`.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detailed statistical analysis and visualization to understand housing market trends.
- **Visualization**: In-depth visualization to reveal data patterns and insights.
